"""Functionality for tracking dependencies in a system.

Nothing in this file should normally need to be directly accessed by users.
A dependency graph will be created automatically by an owning system as necessary,
using the DependencyGraphFactory classes.

This dependency system was originally based on the Drake caching system:

https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__cache__design__notes.html

However, a direct port of that caching system turned out to be extremely inefficient
in JAX.  Due to the need to trace through all the control flow involved in detailed
cache invalidation, compile times suffered noticeably without any major improvement
in runtime for "typical" systems.

As a result, this system is currently barely used (only for determining LeafSystem
feedthrough during automatic loop detection), but is preserved in case it is useful
for when function ordering replaces the current lazy evaluation model.

The basic idea is that any value on which a computation might depend is associated
with an integer "dependency ticket" managed by the DependencyTicket singleton class.
These tickets may be associated with a specific system-level value (e.g. a parameter
or port value), or they may be composites that represent a group of tickets (e.g.
`DependencyTicket.x` for all state variables.

On a system level, all "cache sources" (usually these are ports or ODE RHS functions),
discrete state components, and parameters are each associated with a dependency ticket.
A "dependency graph" is a system-level mapping from these dependency tickets to
DependencyTracker objects, which can contain references to "prerequisites" (other
trackers on which the current tracker depends) and "subscribers" (other
trackers that depend on the current tracker).  Diagram-level trackers may
therefore reference leaf system trackers as prerequisites or subscribers via composite
tickets like "all input ports" (`DependencyTicket.u`).

If a dependency tracker is associated with a callback function, it also contains enough
information to uniquely identify that function given the corresponding system.

The resulting dependency graph contains a complete picture of information flow in the
system.  The DAG formed by prerequisites of a tracker will include all calculations
required to compute the value associated that tracker.  For instance, given the
dependency ticket for a particular port, `dependency_graph[port_ticket]` will be a
tracker with the direct prerequisites of the port value calculation.  Those
prerequisite trackers will in turn have their own prerequisites, and so on, until the
information propagation reaches "known" values like state variables or parameters.

Currently all this information is unused, but it could for example be used to construct
an explicit graph of function calls for a given system, which could then be sorted
into a more efficient order for compilation.
