    A feedforward neural network block representing an Equinox multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP). The output `y` of the MLP is computed as

        y = MLP(x, theta)
    ```

    where `theta` are the parameters of the MLP, and `x` is the input to the MLP.
    This block is differentialble w.r.t. the MLP parameters `theta`. Note that `theta`,
    does not include the hyperparameters representing the architecture of the MLP.

    Input ports:
        (0) The input to the MLP.

    Output ports:
        (0) The output of the MLP.

    Parameters:
        in_size (int):
            The dimension of the input to the MLP.
        out_size (int):
            The dimension of the output of the MLP.

            The width of every hidden layers of the MLP.
        depth (int):
            The depth of the MLP. This represents the number of hidden layers,
            including the output layer.
        seed (int):
            The seed for the random number generator for initialization of the
            MLP parameters (weights and biases of every layer).
            If None, a random 32-bit seed will be generated.
        activation_str (str):
            The activation function to use after each internal layer of the MLP.
            Possible values are "relu", "sigmoid", "tanh", "elu", "swish", "rbf",
            and "identity". Default is "relu".
        final_activation_str (str):
            The activation function to use for the output layer of the MLP.
            Possible values are "relu", "sigmoid", "tanh", "elu", "swish", "rbf",
            and "identity". Default is "identity".
        use_bias (bool):
            Whether to add a bias to the internal layers of the MLP.
            Default is True.
        use_final_bias (bool):
            Wheter to add a bias to the output layer of the MLP.
            Default is True.
        file_name (str):
            Optional file name containing the serialized parameters of the MLP.

        it seems unnecessary to force the user to serialize the hyperparameters of the
        MLP in the strict form chosen by Collimator. It would seem much easier
        for the user to just input these hyperparameters when creating the MLP block
        in Collimator UI, and upload the naturally produced serialized parameters file
        by Equinox.
        (ii) The user may want to train the Equinox MLP within Collimator in a notebook,
        and then use the block within Colimator UI. In this case, while serialization of
        the hyperparameters of the MLP would be a litte more convenient compared
        to manually inputting the hyperparameters in the UI, it seems like a small
        convenience relative to disadvantages of (i). Ideally the user should be
        able to use the API to push the learnt parameters.
        (iii) When we support training in the UI, the hyperparameters are naturally
        serialzed with `declare_configuraton_parameters`, and thus, in this case too,
        only serializatio of the MLP parameters is necessary.

        The choice of an optional `mlp_params` is to enable training of the
        models in a notebook and easily seralizing them for use in the UI.
