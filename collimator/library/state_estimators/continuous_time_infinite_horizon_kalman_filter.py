        Obtain a continuous-time Infinite Horizon Kalman Filter system for a
        continuous-time plant after linearization at equilibrium point (x_eq, u_eq)

        The input plant contains the deterministic forms of the forward and observation
        operators:

        ```
            dx/dt = f(x,u)
            y = g(x,u)
        ```

        Note: Only plants with one vector-valued input and one vector-valued output
        are currently supported. Furthermore, the plant LeafSystem/Diagram should have
        only one vector-valued integrator.

        A plant with disturbances of the following form is then considered
        following form:

        ```
            dx/dt = f(x,u) + G w
            y = g(x,u) +  v
        ```

        where:

            `w` represents the process noise,
            `v` represents the measurement noise,

        and

        ```
            E(w) = E(v) = 0
            E(ww') = Q
            E(vv') = R
            E(wv') = N = 0
        ```

        This plant with disturbances is linearized (only `f` and `q`) around the
        equilibrium point to obtain:

        ```
            d/dt (x_bar) = A x_bar + B u_bar + G w    --- (C1)
            y_bar = C x_bar + D u_bar + v             --- (C2)
        ```

        where,

        ```
            x_bar = x - x_eq
            u_bar = u - u_eq
            y_bar = y - y_bar
            y_eq = g(x_eq, u_eq)
        ```

        A continuous-time Kalman Filter estimator for the system of equations (C1) and
        (C2) is returned. This filter is in the `x_bar`, `u_bar`, and `y_bar`
        states.

        The returned system will have

        Input ports:
            (0) u_bar : continuous-time control vector relative to equilibrium point
            (1) y_bar : continuous-time measurement vector relative to equilibrium point

        Output ports:
            (1) x_hat_bar : continuous-time state vector estimate relative to
                            equilibrium point

        Parameters:
            plant : a `Plant` object which can be a LeafSystem or a Diagram.
            x_eq: ndarray
                Equilibrium state vector for discretization

                Measurement noise covariance matrix.
            G: ndarray
                Process noise matrix. If `None`, `G=B` is assumed making disrurbances
                additive to control vector `u`, i.e. `u_disturbed = u_orig + w`.
            x_hat_bar_0: ndarray
                Initial state estimate relative to equilibrium point.
                If None, an identity matrix is assumed.
