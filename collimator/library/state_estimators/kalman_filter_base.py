    """
    Base class for discrete-time Kalman Filters and its variants.

    ```
                        +----------------------------+
    --- u[n] --->-------|                            |
                        |  Kalman Filter or variant  |----->--- x_hat[n] ---
    --- y[n] --->------+|                            |
                        +----------------------------+
    ```

    The filter starts with a guess `x_hat_0` of the state vector `x` and a guess
    `P_hat_0` of the state covariance matrix `P`.

    At the beginning of each timestep [n], the filter corrects its state and covariance
    estimates based on the control input `u[n]` and the measurement `y[n]`. This is the
    `correct` step.

    Correct step:
        `x_hat[n|n], P_hat[n|n] = correct(x_hat[n|n-1], P_hat[n|n-1], u[n], y[n])`

        Here, x_hat[n|n-1] and P_hat[n|n-1] represent the state estimate given all the
        measurements up tp t[n-1]

    This corrected state is the output of the filter between t[n] and t[n+1].

    Subsequently, after state correction, and also at the beginning of the time step
    t[n], the corrected state and covariance are propagated forwad to the next time
    step t[n+1] using the dynamics. This is the 'predict' or `propagate` step.

    Propagate step:
        `x_hat[n+1|n], P_hat[n+1|n] = propagate(x_hat[n|n], P_hat[n|n], u[n])`

        These internal predicted state and covariance (n+1|n) are the pre-corrected
        state and covariance for time step t[n+1].

    In the implementation below, the pre-corrected state and covariances are denoted by
    `x_hat_minus` and `P_hat_minus`, respectively, and the post-corrected state and
    covariances are denoted by `x_hat_plus` and `P_hat_plus`, respectively.

    The various filters that inherit from this class implement the `correct` and
    the `predict` steps. The `correct` step is implemented by the `_correct` method,
    and the `predict` step is implemented by the `_propagate` method.

    All filters created by this class will have the following ports:

    Input ports:
        (0) u[n] : control vector at timestep n
        (1) y[n] : measurement vector at timestep n

    Output ports:
        (1) x_hat[n] : state vector estimate at timestep n

        x_hat_0: ndarray

        because, the output of the filter at t[n] is the `_plus` state, while the

        for the next time step.
