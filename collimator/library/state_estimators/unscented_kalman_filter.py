    Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for the following system:

    `f` and `g` are discrete-time functions of state `x[n]` and control `u[n]`,
    while R` and `G` are discrete-time functions of time `t[n]`. `Q` is a discrete-time
    function of `t[n], x[n], u[n]`. This last aspect is included for zero-order-hold
    discretization of a continuous-time system

    Input ports:
        (0) u[n] : control vector at timestep n
        (1) y[n] : measurement vector at timestep n

            the state. Default is 0.0.

        Unscented Kalman Filter system for a continuous-time plant.

        The input plant contains the deterministic forms of the forward and observation
        operators:

        ```
            dx/dt = f(x,u)
            y = g(x,u)
        ```

        Note: (i) Only plants with one vector-valued input and one vector-valued output
        are currently supported. Furthermore, the plant LeafSystem/Diagram should have
        only one vector-valued integrator; (ii) the user may pass a plant with
        disturbances (not recommended) as the input plant. In this case, the forward
        and observation evaluations will be corrupted by noise.

        A plant with disturbances of the following form is then considered:

        ```
            dx/dt = f(x,u) + G(t) w         -- (C1)
            y = g(x,u) +  v                 -- (C2)
        ```

        where:

            `w` represents the process noise,
            `v` represents the measurement noise,

        and

        ```
            E(w) = E(v) = 0
            E(ww') = Q(t)
            E(vv') = R(t)
            E(wv') = N(t) = 0
        ```

        This plant is discretized to obtain the following form:

        ```
            x[n+1] = fd(x[n], u[n]) + Gd w[n]  -- (D1)
            y[n]   = gd(x[n], u[n]) + v[n]     -- (D2)

            E(w[n]) = E(v[n]) = 0
            E(w[n]w'[n]) = Qd
            E(v[n]v'[n] = Rd
            E(w[n]v'[n] = Nd = 0
        ```

        The above discretization is performed either via the `euler` or the `zoh`
        method, and an Unscented Kalman Filter estimator for the system of equations
        (D1) and (D2) is returned.

        Note: If `discretized_noise` is True, then it is assumed that the user is
        directly providing Gd, Qd and Rd. If False, then Qd and Rd are computed from
        continuous-time Q, R, and G, and Gd is set to an Identity matrix.

        The returned system will have:

        Input ports:
            (0) u[n] : control vector at timestep n
            (1) y[n] : measurement vector at timestep n

        Output ports:
            (1) x_hat[n] : state vector estimate at timestep n

                Initial state estimate

                matrix is assumed.

                Method to discretize the continuous-time plant. Default is "euler".
            discretized_noise: bool

            alpha: float
                Sigma point spread to control the amount of nonlinearities taken into
                account. Usually set to a value (1e-04<= alpha <= 1.0). Default is 1.0.
            beta: float
                Scaling constant to include prior information about the distribution of
                the state. Default is 0.0.

            alpha: float
                Sigma point spread to control the amount of nonlinearities taken into
                account. Usually set to a value (1e-04<= alpha <= 1.0). Default is 1.0.
            beta: float
                Scaling constant to include prior information about the distribution of
                the state. Default is 0.0.
            kappa: float
                Relatively non-critical parameter to control the kurtosis of sigma
                point distribution. Default is 0.0.
