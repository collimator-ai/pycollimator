        Obtain an Infinite Horizon Kalman Filter system for a continuous-time plant
        after linearization at equilibrium point (x_eq, u_eq)

        The input plant contains the deterministic forms of the forward and observation
        operators:

        ```
            dx/dt = f(x,u)
            y = g(x,u)
        ```

        Note: (i) Only plants with one vector-valued input and one vector-valued output
        are currently supported. Furthermore, the plant LeafSystem/Diagram should have
        only one vector-valued integrator. (ii) the user may pass a plant with
        disturbances as the input plant. However, computation of `y_eq` will be fraught
        with disturbances.

        A plant with disturbances of the following form is then considered
        following form:

        ```
            dx/dt = f(x,u) + G w                        --- (C1)
            y = g(x,u) +  v                             --- (C2)
        ```

        where:

            `w` represents the process noise,
            `v` represents the measurement noise,

        and

        ```
            E(w) = E(v) = 0
            E(ww') = Q
            E(vv') = R
            E(wv') = N = 0
        ```

        This plant with disturbances is linearized (only `f` and `g`) around the
        equilibrium point to obtain:

        ```
            d/dt (x_bar) = A x_bar + B u_bar + G w
            y_bar = C x_bar + D u_bar + v
        ```

        where,

        ```
            x_bar = x - x_eq
            u_bar = u - u_eq
            y_bar = y - y_bar
            y_eq = g(x_eq, u_eq)
        ```

        The linearized plant is then discretized via `euler` or `zoh` method to obtain:

        ```
            x_bar[n] = Ad x_bar[n] + Bd u_bar[n] + Gd w[n]           --- (L1)
            y_bar[n] = Cd x_bar[n] + Dd u_bar[n] + v[n]              --- (L2)

            E(w[n]) = E(v[n]) = 0
            E(w[n]w'[n]) = Qd
            E(v[n]v'[n]) = Rd
            E(w[n]v'[n]) = Nd = 0
        ```

        Note: If `discretized_noise` is True, then it is assumed that the user is
        providing Gd, Qd and Rd. If False, then Qd and Rd are computed from
        continuous-time Q, R, and G, and Gd is set to Identity matrix.

        An Infinite Horizon Kalman Filter estimator for the system of equations (L1)
        and (L2) is returned. This filter is in the `x_bar`, `u_bar`, and `y_bar`
        states.

        This returned system will have

        Input ports:
            (0) u_bar[n] : control vector at timestep n, relative to equilibrium
            (1) y_bar[n] : measurement vector at timestep n, relative to equilibrium

        Output ports:
            (1) x_hat_bar[n] : state vector estimate at timestep n, relative to
                               equilibrium

        Parameters:
            plant : a `Plant` object which can be a LeafSystem or a Diagram.
            x_eq: ndarray
                Equilibrium state vector for discretization
            u_eq: ndarray
                Equilibrium control vector for discretization
            dt: float
                Time step for the discretization.
            Q: ndarray
                Process noise covariance matrix. If `None`, Identity matrix of size
                compatible with `G` and and linearized system's `A` is assumed.
            R: ndarray
                Measurement noise covariance matrix. If `None`, Identity matrix of size
                compatible with linearized system's `C` and `A` is assumed.
            G: ndarray
                Process noise matrix. If `None`, `G=B` is assumed making disrurbances
                additive to control vector `u`, i.e. `u_disturbed = u_orig + w`.
            x_hat_bar_0: ndarray
                Initial state estimate relative to equilibrium.
                If None, an identity matrix is assumed.
            discretization_method: str ("euler" or "zoh")
                Method to discretize the continuous-time plant. Default is "euler".
            discretized_noise: bool
                Whether the user is directly providing Gd, Qd and Rd. Default is False.
                If True, `G`, `Q`, and `R` are assumed to be Gd, Qd, and Rd,
                respectively.
