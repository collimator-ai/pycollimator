        Obtain a Kalman Filter system for a continuous-time plant after linearization
        at equilibrium point (x_eq, u_eq)

        The input plant contains the deterministic forms of the forward and observation
        operators:

        ```
            dx/dt = f(x,u)
            y = g(x,u)
        ```

        Note: (i) Only plants with one vector-valued input and one vector-valued output
        are currently supported. Furthermore, the plant LeafSystem/Diagram should have
        only one vector-valued integrator.

        A plant with disturbances of the following form is then considered
        following form:

        ```
            dx/dt = f(x,u) + G w                        --- (C1)
            y = g(x,u) +  v                             --- (C2)
        ```

        where:

            `w` represents the process noise,
            `v` represents the measurement noise,

        and

        ```
            E(w) = E(v) = 0
            E(ww') = Q
            E(vv') = R
            E(wv') = N = 0
        ```

        This plant with disturbances is linearized (only `f` and `g`) around the
        equilibrium point to obtain:

        ```
            d/dt (x_bar) = A x_bar + B u_bar + G w
            y_bar = C x_bar + D u_bar + v
        ```

        where,

        ```
            x_bar = x - x_eq
            u_bar = u - u_eq
            y_bar = y - y_bar
            y_eq = g(x_eq, u_eq)
        ```

        The linearized plant is then discretized via `euler` or `zoh` method to obtain:

        ```
            x_bar[n] = Ad x_bar[n] + Bd u_bar[n] + Gd w[n]           --- (L1)
            y_bar[n] = Cd x_bar[n] + Dd u_bar[n] + v[n]              --- (L2)

            E(w[n]) = E(v[n]) = 0
            E(w[n]w'[n]) = Qd
            E(v[n]v'[n]) = Rd
            E(w[n]v'[n]) = Nd = 0
        ```

        Note: If `discretized_noise` is True, then it is assumed that the user is
        providing Gd, Qd and Rd. If False, then Qd and Rd are computed from
        continuous-time Q, R, and G, and Gd is set to Identity matrix.

        A Kalman Filter estimator for the system of equations (L1) and (L2) is
        created and returned. This filter is in the `x_bar`, `u_bar`, and `y_bar`
        states.

        This returned system will have

        Input ports:
            (0) u_bar[n] : control vector at timestep n, relative to equilibrium
            (1) y_bar[n] : measurement vector at timestep n, relative to equilibrium

        Output ports:
            (1) x_hat_bar[n] : state vector estimate at timestep n, relative to
                               equilibrium

        Parameters:
            plant : a `Plant` object which can be a LeafSystem or a Diagram.

                Equilibrium state vector for discretization
            u_eq: ndarray
                Equilibrium control vector for discretization
            dt: float
                Time step for the discretization.
            Q: ndarray
                Process noise covariance matrix. If `None`, Identity matrix of size
                compatible with `G` and and linearized system's `A` is assumed.
            R: ndarray
                Measurement noise covariance matrix. If `None`, Identity matrix of size
                compatible with linearized system's `C` and `A` is assumed.
            G: ndarray
                Process noise matrix. If `None`, `G=B` is assumed making disrurbances
                additive to control vector `u`, i.e. `u_disturbed = u_orig + w`.
            x_hat_bar_0: ndarray
                Initial state estimate, relative to equilirium.
                If None, an identity matrix is assumed.
            P_hat_bar_0: ndarray
                Initial covariance matrix estimate for state, relative to equilibrium.
                If `None`, an Identity matrix is assumed.
            discretization_method: str ("euler" or "zoh")
                Method to discretize the continuous-time plant. Default is "euler".
            discretized_noise: bool
                Whether the user is directly providing Gd, Qd and Rd. Default is False.
                If True, `G`, `Q`, and `R` are assumed to be Gd, Qd, and Rd,
                respectively.
