class RandomNumber(LeafSystem):
    """Discrete-time random number generator.

    Generates independent, identically distributed random numbers at each time step.
    Dispatches to `jax.random` for the actual random number generation.

    Supported distributions include "ball", "cauchy", "choice", "dirichlet",
    "exponential", "gamma", "lognormal", "maxwell", "normal", "orthogonal",
    "poisson", "randint", "truncated_normal", and "uniform".

    See https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.random.html#random-samplers
    for a full list of available distributions and associated parameters.

    Although the JAX random number generator is a deterministic function of the
    key, this block maintains the key as part of the discrete state, making it a
    stateful RNG.  The block can be seeded for reproducibility by passing an integer
    seed; if None, a random seed will be generated using numpy.random.

    Note that this block should typically not be used as a source of randomness for
    continuous-time systems, as it generates a discrete-time signal. For continuous
    systems, use a continuous-time noise source, such as `WhiteNoise`.

    Input ports:
        None

    Output ports:
        (0) The most recently generated random number.

    Parameters:
        dt: The rate at which random numbers are generated.
        distribution: The name of the random distribution to sample from.
        seed: An integer seed for the random number generator. If None, a random 32-bit
            seed will be generated.
        dtype: data type of the random number.  If None, the default data type for the
            specified distribution will be used.  Not all distributions support all
            data types; check the JAX documentation for details.
        distribution_parameters: A dictionary of additional parameters to pass to the
            distribution function.

class WhiteNoise(LeafSystem):
    """Continuous-time white noise generator.

    Generates a band-limited white noise signal using a sinc-interpolated random
    number generator.  The output signal is a continuous-time signal, but the
    underlying random number generator is discrete-time.  As a result, the signal
    is not truly white, but is band-limited by the sample rate.  The resulting signal
    has the following approximate power spectral density:
    ```
    S(f) = A * fs if |f| < fs else 0,
    ```
    where `A` is the noise power and `fs = 1/dt` is the sample rate.

    See Ch. 10.4 in Baraniuk, "Signal Processing and Modeling" for details:
        https://shorturl.at/floRZ

    The output signal will have variance `A`, zero mean, and will decorrelate at
    the sample rate.

    Input ports:
        None

    Output ports:
        (0) The band-limited white noise signal with variance `noise_power`, zero
            mean, and correlation time `dt`.

    Parameters:
        correlation_time: The correlation time of the output signal and the inverse of
            the bandwidth. It is the sample frequency of the underlying random number
            generator.
        noise_power: The variance of the white noise signal. Also scales the amplitude
            of the power spectral density.
        num_samples: The number of samples to use for sinc interpolation.  More samples
            will result in a more accurate approximation of the ideal power spectrum,
            but will also increase the computational cost.  The default of 10 is
            sufficient for most applications.
        seed: An integer seed for the random number generator. If None, a random 32-bit
            seed will be generated.
        dtype: data type of the random number.  If None, defaults to float.
        shape: The shape of the output signal.  If empty, the output will be a scalar.
