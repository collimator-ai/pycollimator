"""Base class for System objects.

Systems are the basic building blocks of a model in the collimator framework.
In isolation they represent a hybrid dynamical system, but they can also be
combined into block diagrams to represent more complex models.  The interface
defined by SystemBase is intended for composability, so diagrams can themselves
be treated as "blocks" in larger diagrams.

Systems are intended to act as a collection of pure functions, with the
"dynamic" data (time, state, etc.) stored in a corresponding Context object.
For example, `system.eval_time_derivatives(context)` will return the time
derivatives of the continuous state for the system, given the root context of
the diagram.

        Returns:
            State: The complete state with all updates applied.

        Notes:
            (1) Following the Drake definition, "unrestricted" updates are allowed to
            modify any component of the state: continuous, discrete, or mode.  These
            updates are evaluated in the order in which they were declared, so it is
            _possible_ (but should be strictly avoided) for multiple events to modify the
            same state component at the same time.

            Each update computes its results given the _current_ state of the system
            (the "minus" values) and returns the _updated_ state (the "plus" values).
            The update functions cannot access any information about the "plus" values of
            its own state or the state of any other block.  This could change in the future
            but for now it ensures consistency with Drake's discrete semantices:

            More specifically, since all unrestricted updates can modify the entire state,
            any time there are multiple unrestricted updates, the resulting states are
            ALWAYS in conflict.  For example, suppose a system has two unrestricted
            updates, `event1` and `event2`.  At time t_n, `event1` is active and `event2`
            is inactive.  First, `event1` is evaluated, and the state is updated.  Then
            `event2` is evaluated, but the state is not updated.  Which one is valid?
            Obviously, the `event1` return is valid, but how do we communicate this to JAX?
            The situation is more complicated if both `event1` and `event2` happen to be
            active.  In this case the states have to be "merged" somehow.  In the worst
            case, these two will modify the same components of the state in different ways.

            The implementation updates the state in a local copy of the context (since both
            are immutable).  This allows multiple unrestricted updates, but leaves open the
            possibility of multiple active updates modifying the state in conflicting ways.
            This should strictly be avoided by the implementer of the LeafSystem.  If it is
            at all unclear how to do this, it may be better to split the system into
            multiple blocks to be safe.

            (2) The events are evaluated conditionally on being marked "active"
            (indicating that their guard function triggered), so the entire event
            collection can be passed without filtering to active events. This is necessary
            to make the function calls work with JAX tracing, which do not allow for
            variable-sized arguments or returns.
        """
        pass

    def handle_discrete_update(
        self, events: EventCollection, context: ContextBase
    ) -> ContextBase:
        """Compute and apply active discrete updates.

        Given the _root_ context, evaluate the discrete updates, which must have the
        same PyTree structure as the discrete states of this system. This should be
        a pure function, so that it does not modify any aspect of the context in-place
        (even though it is difficult to strictly prevent this in Python).

        This will evaluate the set of events that result from declaring state or output
        update events on systems using `LeafSystem.declare_periodic_update` and
        `LeafSystem.declare_output_port` with an associated periodic update rate.

        This is intended for internal use by the simulator and should not normally need
        to be invoked directly by users. Events are evaluated conditionally on being
        marked "active", so the entire event collection can be passed without filtering
        to active events. This is necessary to make the function calls work with JAX
        tracing, which do not allow for variable-sized arguments or returns.

        For a discrete system updating at a particular rate, the update rule for a
        particular block is:

        ```
        x[n+1] = f(t[n], x[n], u[n])
        y[n]   = g(t[n], x[n], u[n])
        ```

        Additionally, the value y[n] is held constant until the next update from the
        point of view of other continuous-time or asynchronous discrete-time blocks.

        Because each output `y[n]` may in general depend on the input `u[n]` evaluated
        _at the same time_, the composite discrete update function represents a
        system of equations.  However, since algebraic loops are prohibited, the events
        can be ordered and executed sequentially to ensure that the updates are applied
        in the correct order.  This is implemented in
        `SystemBase.sorted_event_callbacks`.

        Multirate systems work in the same way, except that the events are evaluated
        conditionally on whether the current time corresponds to an update time for each
        event.

        Parameters are declared in the system and accessed through the context to
        maintain separation of data ownership. This method creates an entry in the
        system's dynamic_parameters, recording the name, default value, and dependency
        ticket for later reference.

        The default value will be used to initialize the context, so it
        will also serve as the initial value unless explicitly overridden. In the
        simplest cases, parameters could be stored as attributes of the LeafSystem,
        but declaring them has the advantage of moving the values to the context,
        allowing them to be traced by JAX rather than stored as static data. This
        means they can be differentiated, vmapped, or otherwise modified without
        re-compiling the simulation.

        Args:
            name (str):
                The name of the parameter.
            default_value (Union[Array, Parameter], optional):
                The default value of the parameter. Parameters are used
                primarily internally for serialization and should not normally need
                to be used directly when implementing LeafSystems. Defaults to None.
            shape (ShapeLike, optional):
                The shape of the parameter. Defaults to None.
            dtype (DTypeLike, optional):
                The data type of the parameter. Defaults to None.
            as_array (bool, optional):
                If True, treat the default_value as an array-like (cast if necessary).
                Otherwise, it will be stored as the default state without modification.

        Raises:
            AssertionError:
                If the parameter with the given name is already declared.

        Notes:
            (1) Only one of `shape` and `default_value` should be provided. If
            `default_value` is provided, it will be used as the initial value of the
            continuous state. If `shape` is provided, the initial value will be a
            zero vector of the given shape and specified dtype.
